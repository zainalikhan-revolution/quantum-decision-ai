\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Motivation:} Human decision-making shows quantum-like properties (superposition, entanglement, probabilistic collapse).

\textbf{Approach:} We present a quantum-inspired computational framework that models option superposition, inter-option entanglement, and measurement modulated by human factors (confidence, emotion, time pressure).

\textbf{Results:} Across 1,500 synthetic decision scenarios and multiple human datasets (Iowa Gambling Task, Mouselab-MDP, Kaggle survey, and a self-collected Google Form study), our model achieved 78.3\% prediction accuracy—representing an 11.4\% improvement over classical machine learning baselines. The quantum uncertainty metric strongly correlated with reliability ($r = -0.620, p < 0.001$), enabling effective confidence calibration.

\textbf{Significance:} The work formalizes a practical framework and uncertainty metric for human-AI decision support and sets a clear path to empirical validation.

% INTRODUCTION
% ============================
\section{Introduction}

Human decision-making represents one of the most sophisticated cognitive processes, characterized by simultaneous consideration of multiple possibilities, emotional weighting, contextual adaptation, and inherent uncertainty management~\cite{kahneman2011thinking}. Unlike algorithmic decision processes that evaluate options sequentially, human cognition appears to maintain multiple potential choices in parallel—a mental ``superposition''—before probabilistically collapsing to a final decision through mechanisms that parallel quantum mechanical processes~\cite{busemeyer2012quantum}.

Traditional artificial intelligence approaches struggle to capture these nuanced aspects of human cognition. Classical machine learning models often treat decisions as deterministic mappings from input features to output choices, failing to represent the fundamental uncertainty, simultaneity, and interconnectedness that characterize human intuitive processes. This limitation becomes particularly problematic in human-AI collaboration contexts where understanding and predicting human decision patterns is crucial for system effectiveness~\cite{russell2019human}.

Recent advances in quantum computing have inspired novel computational paradigms that may better model complex cognitive processes~\cite{biamonte2017quantum}. Quantum principles—superposition (multiple states existing simultaneously), entanglement (correlations between elements), and measurement (probabilistic state collapse)—offer compelling analogies to human decision-making processes observed in cognitive psychology and behavioral economics research.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning}

Quantum-inspired computing has shown promise across diverse domains. Liu et al. demonstrated a quantum-train methodology for neural network optimization~\cite{liu2024quantum}, while Zhang et al. explored quantum dynamics compilation for enhanced computational efficiency~\cite{zhang2024scalable}. Franco et al. combined quantum machine learning with explainable feature selection, emphasizing interpretability~\cite{franco2025quantum}. Additional work includes quantum-inspired neural networks for optical illusions~\cite{maksymov2024quantum} and broader surveys of machine learning within quantum domains~\cite{dunjko2018machine}.

\subsection{Cognitive Modeling and Decision Theory}

Classical decision theory relies on rational choice and expected utility~\cite{kahneman2011thinking}, yet empirical evidence reveals systematic deviations from rational behavior, including preference reversals and context-dependent choices. Quantum cognition research proposes that human cognitive processes exhibit quantum-like properties~\cite{busemeyer2012quantum}, providing a theoretical foundation for the computational approach developed here.

\subsection{Uncertainty Quantification in AI Systems}

Uncertainty quantification is critical in high-stakes AI applications~\cite{gal2016dropout}. Bayesian and ensemble methods are popular, but often struggle to capture the complex, context-dependent uncertainty patterns that mirror human cognition. Our framework introduces a quantum-inspired uncertainty representation tailored to decision behavior.

% METHODOLOGY
% ============================
\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Quantum-Inspired Decision Framework}

We model human decision-making through three stages: superposition creation, entanglement application, and quantum measurement with human factors.

\subsubsection{Quantum Superposition State Creation}

For a decision scenario with $n$ choices and feature vector $\mathbf{f} = [f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_m]$, we create the initial quantum state:
\begin{equation}
|\psi_0\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i e^{i\phi_i} |i\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_i$ is the probability amplitude for choice $i$, $\phi_i$ is a phase term, and $|i\rangle$ denotes the $i$th basis state. Initial amplitudes incorporate scenario features via
\begin{equation}
\alpha_i = \frac{a_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^n a_j^2}},
\end{equation}
with base amplitudes
\begin{equation}
a_i = r_i + \sum_{k=1}^{m} w_{ik} f_k \cdot c,
\end{equation}
where $r_i \sim U(0.5, 1)$ provides variation, $w_{ik}$ are learned weights, and $c$ is the confidence level.

\subsubsection{Quantum Entanglement Application}

Human cognition exhibits correlations between decision options through associative memory and context. We model this via entanglement:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\alpha}_i = \alpha_i + \sum_{j \neq i} E_{ij} \alpha_j e^{i(\phi_j - \phi_i)},
\end{equation}
where $E_{ij}$ represents entanglement strength between options $i$ and $j$. The symmetric entanglement matrix $E$ captures learned correlations.

\subsubsection{Quantum Measurement with Human Factors}

Final decisions emerge through quantum measurement incorporating human-specific factors. Base probabilities from entangled amplitudes are
\begin{equation}
P_i^{\text{base}} = \left|\tilde{\alpha}_i^{\text{norm}}\right|^2.
\end{equation}
We modify these by human factors:
\begin{equation}
P_i^{\text{human}} = P_i^{\text{base}} \cdot C_i(c) \cdot E_i(e) \cdot T_i(t),
\end{equation}
where confidence sharpens distributions:
\begin{equation}
C_i(c) = 1 + (c - 0.5)\,\lambda_c \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \mathrm{rank}\!\left(P_i^{\text{base}}\right)},
\end{equation}
emotion biases choices:
\begin{equation}
E_i(e)=
\begin{cases}
1 + e\,\lambda_e, & \text{if } i = \arg\max_j P_j^{\text{base}},\\
1 - \dfrac{e\,\lambda_e}{n-1}, & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
and time pressure down-weights low-probability options:
\begin{equation}
T_i(t) = 1 - t\,\lambda_t \left(1 - P_i^{\text{base}}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
Uncertainty is quantified using Shannon entropy:
\begin{equation}
U = -\sum_{i=1}^n P_i \log_2 P_i.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Parameter Optimization}

Framework parameters $\Theta = \{w_{ik}, E_{ij}, \lambda_c, \lambda_e, \lambda_t\}$ are learned via gradient-based optimization with loss
\begin{equation}
L(\Theta) = L_{\text{accuracy}} + \beta\,L_{\text{uncertainty}} + \gamma\,L_{\text{regularization}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Training Algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[t]
\caption{Quantum-Inspired Decision Model Training}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{Input:} dataset $\mathcal{D}$, learning rate $\eta$, epochs $E$
\STATE Initialize $\Theta = \{w_{ik}, E_{ij}, \lambda_c, \lambda_e, \lambda_t\}$
\FOR{$e=1$ to $E$}
  \FOR{batch $B \subset \mathcal{D}$}
    \STATE Build superposition, apply entanglement, compute $P_i^{\text{human}}$
    \STATE Compute entropy $U$ and loss $L(\Theta)$
    \STATE Backpropagate gradients and update $\Theta \leftarrow \Theta - \eta \nabla_\Theta L$
  \ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\STATE \textbf{Output:} trained parameters $\Theta$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

% EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
% ============================
\section{Experimental Design}

We generated 1,500 synthetic decision scenarios across five domains (financial, career, health, consumer, strategic), each with realistic cognitive patterns based on psychological research. Each scenario contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item Feature vector: risk, complexity, time pressure, reward (normalized to $[0,1]$).
\item Human characteristics: confidence, emotion, time sensitivity.
\item Ground-truth decisions based on prospect-theory-driven heuristics and satisficing behavior.
\end{itemize}
Baselines include Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression (LR) with optimized hyperparameters using 5-fold stratified cross-validation.

\section{Datasets}

To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we combine synthetic, benchmark, and real human data sources. Benchmarks include the Iowa Gambling Task and Mouselab-MDP; large-scale survey features are taken from the Kaggle machine learning survey; and we incorporate a self-collected Google Form study capturing choices, confidence ratings, and emotional states. This combination provides internal validity through controlled scenarios and external validity via authentic human responses.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Overall Performance}

Table~\ref{tab:accuracy} shows 5-fold cross-validation accuracy with statistical testing.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Decision Prediction Accuracy Comparison}
\label{tab:accuracy}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Accuracy (\%)} \\ \midrule
Quantum-Inspired & 78.3 \\
Random Forest & 66.2 \\
Support Vector Machine & 65.8 \\
Multi-Layer Perceptron & 66.9 \\
Logistic Regression & 64.9 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The quantum-inspired framework achieves 78.3\% accuracy, an 11.4\% absolute improvement over the best classical method ($p < 0.001$, paired $t$-test). Effect sizes (Cohen's $d$) indicate large practical significance across comparisons.

\subsection{Comprehensive Results Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:results} presents accuracy comparisons, decision distributions, uncertainty analysis, human-factor effects, and cross-validation distributions.

\label{fig:results}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Uncertainty Quantification Analysis}

The quantum uncertainty metric demonstrates strong predictive power:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mean uncertainty: 0.850 bits.
\item Correlation with accuracy: $r = -0.620$ ($p < 0.001$).
\item High-confidence predictions ($U < 0.3$): 90.0\% accuracy.
\item Low-confidence predictions ($U > 1.2$): 55.0\% accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Human Factor Impact Analysis}

\textbf{Confidence:} High confidence ($c > 0.7$) increases the top-choice probability by 18.3\%. Low confidence ($c < 0.3$) produces more uniform distributions with 23.7\% higher entropy.

\textbf{Emotion:} Financial decisions show stronger risk aversion under high emotion ($\beta = -0.41, p < 0.001$). Health decisions exhibit increased uncertainty seeking ($\beta = 0.33, p < 0.01$).

\textbf{Time Pressure:} High time pressure ($t > 0.7$) reduces accuracy by 12.4\% and increases uncertainty by 15.2\%.

\subsection{Ablation Study}

Component contribution analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Remove entanglement: $-11.2$\% accuracy.
\item Remove confidence integration: $-7.8$\%.
\item Remove emotional weighting: $-4.3$\%.
\item Remove time-pressure modulation: $-3.6$\%.
\end{itemize}
Entanglement contributes the most to performance.

% DISCUSSION
% ============================
\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Theoretical Implications}

Results support the hypothesis that human decision-making exhibits quantum-like computational properties. Superposition captures parallel option consideration, while entanglement models complex correlations that classical approaches struggle to represent. The strong correlation between quantum uncertainty and prediction reliability suggests that quantum-inspired measures can better capture cognitive confidence than traditional heuristics.

\subsection{Practical Applications}

Applications include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Decision Support}: Predictions with calibrated uncertainty for human-AI collaboration.
\item \textbf{Behavioral Modeling}: Richer understanding of choice patterns in psychology and economics.
\item \textbf{Trust-Calibrated AI}: Improved uncertainty quantification for high-stakes domains.
\item \textbf{Personalized Interfaces}: Adaptive systems that respect individual decision styles.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

Our evaluation focuses on individual-level decisions; extending to group or multi-agent contexts is a priority. While confidence, emotion, and time pressure were modeled, exploring memory constraints and social influence may yield further gains. Neurological validation (EEG/fMRI) could strengthen biological plausibility. Future work includes human-subject validation, real-world deployment, multi-agent extensions, and exploration of potential quantum-hardware advantages.
