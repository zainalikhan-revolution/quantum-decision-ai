# MIT App + Paper Booster (Read Me)

This folder gives you ready-to-drop sections for your Overleaf paper and a checklist to make your work
look professional TODAY.

## Files
- `limitations_futurework.tex` – paste into your paper after Results
- `reproducibility.tex` – add near the end of the paper
- `ethics_broader_impact.tex` – optional section for responsibility
- `results_table_template.tex` – a LaTeX table you can replace with your real numbers
- `OVERLEAF_INSERTS.txt` – exact LaTeX commands to include figures/tables
- `MIT_ongoing_research_blurb.txt` – 120–150 words to use in MIT application

## How to Use
1. Run your Colab, generate `table1.tex` and `research_results.png`.
2. Upload both to Overleaf.
3. Insert the commands from `OVERLEAF_INSERTS.txt` where you reference Table I and Figure 1.
4. Add the three sections (`limitations_*.tex`, `reproducibility.tex`, `ethics_*.tex`) into your paper.
5. Push your code + data to GitHub. Paste the link in the Reproducibility section.

Be honest and specific. Admissions reviewers appreciate clarity over hype.
