\section{Limitations and Future Work}
While our quantum-inspired framework shows promise, the current study has several limitations.
First, our primary evaluation uses synthetic decision scenarios; real-world human decision datasets will
be incorporated in future work to test ecological validity. Second, our baseline suite is limited and
does not yet include large transformer-based models or Bayesian neural networks; future experiments will
compare against these families. Third, our entanglement and human-factor parameters are hand-tuned rather
than learned end-to-end. We plan to (i) learn parameters via gradient-based training, (ii) add ablation
studies for superposition/entanglement/human-factor components, (iii) evaluate calibration and
uncertainty under distribution shift, and (iv) release a larger reproducible benchmark for human decision modeling.
