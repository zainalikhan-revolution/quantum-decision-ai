\section{Ethics and Broader Impact}
Modeling human decisions raises ethical considerations including privacy, consent, and potential misuse for
manipulation. Our human-data collection protocol (planned) will use informed consent, anonymization, and
IRB-style safeguards where applicable. We will release only aggregate statistics and deidentified data.
Applications should prioritize decision support and transparency rather than replacement of human judgment.
